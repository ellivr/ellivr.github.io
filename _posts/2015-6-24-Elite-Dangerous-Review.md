title: Elite Dangerous Review

Ok, I've reached Elite rank on one of the branch, got myself Anaconda, and decent amount of playtime, so it's about time for me to start writing review about this game. I got this game far before it even touches steam, then after a year the game come to steam and they gave me free cd key, I really appreciate that! Some other companies dont give a damn about this and require you to rebuy just to get it on steam, Elite: Dangerous is a game where you gonna either hate it or love it.

First of all I refuse to call this game an MMO despite of the tag on store page says so, therefore there's often times many people ask whether this game has similarity with the popular space-mmo EVE Online. But it is very different, you won't find that massiveness in this game, the systems here are instanced to max of 32 players, so you never see those super-super crowd system like EVE's Jita. (Btw there's system called Jita too in Elite). So in short Elite is not MMO, just space game with multiplayer features (That's what I think!)

I often people asking about, "is the game playable with keyboard and mouse setup?" "Do I need to buy stick for this?". Joystick isn't necessary, you should be fine with just keyboard and mouse. I am a KB+Mouse player, and I have no problem hitting elite in combat (still saving money for a good stick lol). However, joystick does help, because it gives you spatial information when you controlling your ship, while simple keyboard + mouse dont. Joystick also gives more immersion while playing. And if you're into this genre, I suggest you to buy yourself one, not just for this game, but many other games that you would enjoy playing with one. A simple Joystick or HOTAS, just choose based on your budget and personal preferences, as for in-game pilot, your character uses HOTAS setup.

The game does have microtransactions inside, in form of paintjobs (skin color) for your ships. But it is not necessary really. The only time you got to see your ships' exterior are when you in outfitting mode and debug camera. Some people do ♥♥♥♥♥es about this thing saying that FrontierDev are stingy or w/e, but come on, you're not going to miss anything without these paintjobs, unless you are that selfie-selfie explorer guys who like to take a good screenshot in style.

Some others ask if the game is like X-series, but not at all. In this game you are just puny little pilot, not some kind of big shot that can build your own empire, raise your own armies, and wreck havock here and there. No you are just a pilot, and you alone can't change the world around you. You are just insignificant compared to the world to make the changes, however you and others pilots can work together to changes it, via powerplay, community projects, or other things. So yeah the world is less sandboxy, but it is not static either, this is kinda game where you make up your own story in your mind.

There's mainly 3 things you can do in this game. Trading, Combat, and Exploration. Trading is pretty straightforward buy low sell high, can also do smuggling illegal items, or you can also become just a space trucker delivering cargo people ask. Combat can branch into bounty hunter, mercenary, or pirate. As for exploration, well you just explore, go anywhere and claim virgins planet to immortalize your name on galaxy map. So far there's no planetary landing, no walk around your ship or stations, you are forever sitting in your cockpit, they said these are planned but dunno when it's gonna be implemented. All I know they have done this before on their previous game, Frontier: Elite II, the seamless planetary landing

The game is grindy to a certain degree. The most expensive ship Anaconda, cost hundred millions and that took a god damn long time, and that's just to buy the ship itself, the module outfitting costs can easily triple the ship cost itself! The game feels less alive compared to others, leaving it up to the player's imagination to make themselves feels alive. and I feel the NPCs are there just for the sake of being there. There are many times I was in deep Empire owned space, got interdicted by a puny Kumo Crew pirates in Sidewinder with measly 400Cr credits, he interdicted me and attacked me just to die, I mean how the hell he get here, this system has a very high security, oh well. Also the NPC dialogues are stiffs, and repeated, they should work on more varied dialogues, because once you hit hundreds of game time, it's same phrases repeated over and over. 

Trading is the fastest way to earn credits also it is the most boring thing out of others, once you figure out a trade route it's just grind time. And Taxi like missions aren't here yet even though we have space luxury taxy called Orca. Though, if you don't mind relaxed play, like Euro Truck Simulator 2, I think you are going to enjoy this Space Trucking thing.

The game is 1:1 replica of milky way, some systems are hand drawn, while others (most of them) are procedurally generated based on computer estimation. Exploration is lacking in terms of depth especially without planetary landing features yet, you just go to random systems, scan potential objects, and jump to other systems, and repeat. Sometimes you gonna find a beautiful sceneries, stars, but most of times you are going to see.... well just your normal systems with nothing interesting,.. time to move on...

That's all, from me. I personally think this game isn't a complete game, just a framework of a bigger and better game. I personally can't thumb down this game because it will be a lie, I do enjoy the game and will keep playing it and see what new stuffs they bring. Buy the game if you're into this genre, have watched lots of review of it, and on sale. Don't forget to click the thumb up button if you like my review, click the thumb down if for some reason you dont like it, or press both if you can ;)
