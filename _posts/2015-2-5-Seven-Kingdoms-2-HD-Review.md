First I want to say no, this game is very different than AoE series, Starcraft series, Rise of Nations, this game has different "vibes" than those and is both unique on its own way.

This game brings back memories. I used to play this game alot when I was high school back then, along with my father. I played both 7k1 and 7k2, 7k2 offers more features, more civilizations to play, as well as it allows you to play as the Frythans, which you cant do on first series. If I remember the only thing that 7k2 missing from original 7k1 is, there's no naval aspect on the game, no sea at all. 

There's two main species that you can play: Human or Frythans (Monsters). Each have different playstyle. As human you need to watch for mineral resources, village loyalty, and stuffs. Human has 12 civilizations, each of them have their own unique soldiers, and their own deities which you can summon them. But as Frythans, you have to massacre humans for Life Points, you don't need to care about minerals (Unless you are minotauros), no village loyalty they pay tributes to you as long as you set up lair to control the village. There are 7 kinds of Frythans, and again each of them has their own unique units, their own unique structures. You can mix all of these by having a unit that different from yours, surrender to you,, you can have access to theirs tech tree. 

And yes, this game has high replayability value.
The only thing that I hate is, no option for windowed mode, which they seems to patched it already as for now!
