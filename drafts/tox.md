I used Skype, my friends are using it. But now I have uninstalled my Skype client and moved to [Tox](https://tox.chat/). So why Tox instead of Skype? So, in this post let me advertise Tox to you!

### Open Source

First of all, [Tox](https://tox.chat/) is open source there are no hidden stuffs, the code is publicly available for you to indulge, I mean "learn". Skype is not, not only that, on December 2013 they also disabled their Desktop API effectifely killing all third party applications to integrate Skype on their apps (like Pidgin or Trillian). I'm not sure if they could now, haven't checked it. 

Anyway, what I want to say is, 

>**Open Source is Good**!

>*Like girls for example, pretty girls are nice to stare at, but it would be more awesome if you could peek what's hidden inside!*

### It is Secure

Tox uses P2P (Peer to Peer) architecture, and the communications are encrypted. So when you send your message to your friend, it will go directly from your PC to your friend's, no one else know what's you're sending. As for Skype, it goes from Your PC -> Skype Server -> Your Friend's PC. Also note that Microsoft does keep track of all of your messages in Skype via PRISM, and then send those to NSA. 

### Not Resource Hog

Skype's client is simply resource heavy, on older machines. While I was using Skype I had to close it to free up some RAM to be able to play a game. As for Tox, there are wide range of Tox Clients to use, as explained below.

### Many Different Flavors

Tox itself isn't a program, it is a protocol. Like Torrent, (or IRC, or something) in order to use it you will need a client. There are many [Tox Clients](https://wiki.tox.chat/clients) out there up for grab, available for wide range of operating systems both desktop and mobile. I personally use [qTox](https://github.com/tux3/qTox).

Don't have powerful PC? Or you just hate to use GUI at all, There's [Console version](https://wiki.tox.chat/clients/toxic?s[]=toxic) if you're into this thing. Or maybe you are a picky person and there are no clients that fit your likings, well you can fork the [ToxCore](https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore), study it and start making your own Tox Client that fits to your liking, that's the power of open source.

### Cool Name
And Lastly. Tox, simple and cool name, like Tux. I'd choose it over Skypee! Pee?! This last part might be unnecessary, maybe I should delete it.

So, set up your Tox now and let's Tox together. Here is my ToxID by the way:
